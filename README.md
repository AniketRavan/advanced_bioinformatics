Second, binding preferences of a TFs have been
shown to be heterogeneous across different cell lines. For instance, Arvey et al. comprehensively analysed
ChIP-seq data for 67 TFs across multiple different and found that many cell-type-specific sequence models
were able to capture binding variability, which was primarily due to differences in heteromeric complex
formations
